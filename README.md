# ProPro-Server

## Introduction

As a common analysis method of proteomics, DIA analysis technology has been widely used. However, many current analysis
software are lack of visualization for data result and analysis processing. ProPro is a web-based DIA data analysis
platform build by Java. In addition to a set of standard processes to deal with DIA data, ProPro provides much more
visualization tables, charts and statistic data for DIA data analysis. The analysis for DIA data. DIA analysis is no
longer a black box. Users can review the identification details of each peptide after analysis.

ProPro also build some specific statistical graph like HYE dataset. <br>
As a highly complex process, DIA data analysis needs to invest a lot of time in iteration and maintenance. We have
formed a big team to constantly update and maintain this new "baby". We promise that ProPro will be free to all the
people exploring in the field of Proteomics.

## User Manual

## Demo Website

Because ProPro is used to process big data of Proteomics, its deployment and maintenance will be relatively complex. In
order to let the users have an intuitive feeling, we provide a demo website <br>
